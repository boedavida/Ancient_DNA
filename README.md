# Ancient_DNA
Python 3 code for computations on ancient DNA

This code was inspired by the report on a fossil named "Oase1" in the reference Fu, Q., et. al. The Genetic History of Ice Age Europe. Nature, May 2016. Oase1 is a modern human fossil mandible (jaw bone) found in Peştera cu Oase, Romania that is dated at 37,000–42,000 years old, which is at a time in which modern humans and Neanderthals overlapped in Europe near the times of both the first appearance of modern humans in Europe and the end of the time range of Neanderthals. Oase1 was a modern human but had a high percentage of Neanderthal DNA, about 10% of the genome. It is fascinating that a human fossil was found that had such recent Neanderthal ancestry. This code--either the Python file or the Jupyter notebook--estimates the number of generations that Oase1 was from a direct Neanderthal ancestor. By changing the values of the variables, this code can be used similarly for other ancient human fossils with Neanderthal ancestry.
